# F4-ATIS
Automatic Terminal Information Service for Falcon BMS 4.33

F4-ATIS requires .NET 4.5.2 and Falcon BMS 4.33 to function properly. F4-ATIS reads zygrib files from the campaign directory to determine the weather at its specified field, and creates ATIS messages based on the current weather, observing changes and adjusting its messages appropriately. It broadcasts these ATIS messages using IVC on a frequency appropriate to its specified field, on a continuous loop.
